Nowadays we live in a data-rich world and with data science jobs on the rise many young researchers from academia make the decision to transition to data. 

## My background
When I started my PhD in 2017 I entered the world of research without a clear idea of where my career was headed. The choice of staying in Paris to research mechanobiology was driven by a passion for the project and the good experience that I had had in the lab during my Master's intership.
I was passionate about microscopy and image analysis and found the biological questions of my research truly interesting. 
Despite the love for my job, the prospects of a career in academics were not attractive. Long hours with few guarantees and low pay and the never ending cycle of grant searching and Post Docs did not seem worth to me for the low chances of becoming a P.I., a job that I could not see myself enjoying.
It's mid-way through my PhD that I started to reflect about what I would do after



## Learning how to code


## Set a good foundation


## Bootcamp: yay or nay?



## Finding the first job
