This set of macros has been developed to perform different tasks in the analysis of confocal and spectral images of epithelial adhesion complexes. The macros allow to quickly segment regions of interest, calculate FRET and perform multiple intensity measurements.

The dataset was obtained from the [Speed Dating Experiment dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment) on Kaggle.
The aim is to investigate the factors and biases influecing the choice of the individual participating to the speed dating sessions.

The goal of the project is to obtain data on different french cities and travel destination that can be potentially implemented in a recommendation app. The application should be based on real data about:

Weather
Hotels in the area
More specifically we are required to:
- Scrape data from destinations
- Get weather data from each destination
- Get hotels' info about each destination
- Store all the information above in a data lake
- Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse
