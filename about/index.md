## Bio
I was born in Italy and grew up in Italy ad Finland.  
As a young student I pursued my studies in Molecular Biology and Genetics. 
In 2017, I participated to the double degree partnership between the Università degli Studi di Padova and Université Paris Diderot and I obtain my masters in Molecular Biology and in Genetics.
Also in 2017, I began my PhD in Physiology and Physiopathology at the Université Paris Cité in the laboratory of Nicolas Borghi.
During this time I grew interested in programming, especially applied to image analysis and automatization of data analysis and began learning Python.
My thesis focused on tracking of cell migration in different contexts (individual cells and groups of cells with and withour cues) and the modeling of migratory paths to understand the underlying principal components of space exploration of cells. Such understanding can help understand the main kinematic components of normal wound repair and metastasis, which both involve cell migration.
After defending my thesis in 2021, I decided to convert to Data Science and follow my interest for programming and analytics.
I am currently completing a Data Science bootcamp at Jedha in Paris, France.
